					Early Career

				<p>
					Thinking outside the box is a common trait she has, whilst many might view this as a quirky personality trait this has been an integral part to her work ethic and way of being. Being skilled in the water is one aspect but she aspires to keep the out the box thinking and is qualified as a pilates teacher with the hopes of bringing this form of exercise to water, along with being an Emmett Therapist (working with animals to better understand working with people :wink: ).

From standing behind a starting block at the age of 7 balling her eyes out because her goggles snapped to standing behind a similar starting block at an Olympic games ready to take on the world.
